## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flexbox-layout-example.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the pages.

## Usage
This project demonstrates how to use CSS Flexbox properties to create various layouts:
- **Header and Footer**: Uses Flexbox for aligning navigation items.
- **Image Layout**: Two images side by side on top and one large image below using Flexbox.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout based on screen size.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses semantic markup with proper element nesting.
- **CSS Box Model**: Utilizes border-box mode with the `box-sizing` property.
- **Selectors**: Implements type, class, and ID selectors.
- **Flexbox Layouts**: Employs Flexbox for modern, responsive design.

### Key Points

- **Flexbox Layouts**: The project now uses Flexbox instead of floats for layout management, providing a more modern and flexible approach.
- **Box-Sizing**: The `box-sizing: border-box;` rule is applied globally to ensure consistent sizing across elements, including padding and borders within the element's total width and height.

This README reflects the current state of your project, highlighting the use of Flexbox and adherence to best practices in CSS, such as using `border-box` for the box model. Adjust any specific paths or descriptions as needed for your project details.
